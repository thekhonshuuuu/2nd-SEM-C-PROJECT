CHAPTER 1: Atoms, Molecules & Chemical Reactions
1.1 What is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the branch of science that studies:

Matter

Its composition

Its properties

How substances interact, combine, or change during reactions

Everything around us—air, water, food, metals—is made of atoms and molecules.

1.2 Atoms

The smallest unit of matter that cannot be broken chemically.

Each element consists of a unique type of atom.

Parts of Atom:

Proton (positive charge)

Neutron (no charge)

Electron (negative charge)

Atomic Number (Z):
Z = number of protons

Mass Number (A):
A = protons + neutrons

1.3 Molecules

Two or more atoms chemically bonded together.

Examples:

H2 = molecule of Hydrogen

O2 = molecule of Oxygen

H2O = molecule of Water

1.4 Ions

Charged atoms or molecules.

Cation = positively charged

Anion = negatively charged

Example:
Na+ , Cl- , Ca2+ , O2-

1.5 Chemical Formula

Shows the symbols of elements and number of atoms.

Examples:

Water: H2O

Carbon dioxide: CO2

Sodium chloride: NaCl

1.6 Chemical Reactions

A chemical reaction transforms reactants into products.

General Form:
Reactants --> Products

Example:
2H2 + O2 --> 2H2O

1.7 Balancing Chemical Equations

Law of Conservation of Mass:
Mass before reaction = Mass after reaction

So, number of atoms on both sides must be equal.

Formulas (Plain Text Format)

Mass Number (A) = Protons + Neutrons
Atomic Number (Z) = Protons
Number of Neutrons = A - Z

Molecular Mass = sum of atomic masses of atoms
Number of Moles = Mass / Molar Mass
Mass = Moles * Molar Mass
Avogadro Number = 6.022 * 10^23

CHAPTER 2: Structure of Atom
2.1 Discovery of Sub-Atomic Particles

Electron:
Discovered by J.J. Thomson using cathode ray tube.

Proton:
Discovered by Rutherford.

Neutron:
Discovered by James Chadwick.

2.2 Atomic Models
Thomson's Model

Plum pudding model

Electrons scattered inside positive sphere

Rutherford's Model

Gold foil experiment

Nucleus at center

Mostly empty space

Bohr’s Model (Important)

Electrons revolve around nucleus in fixed orbits called “shells”.

Shells:
K, L, M, N ... OR n = 1, 2, 3, 4

Maximum electrons:
2 * n^2

Example:
K shell (n=1) --> 2 electrons
L shell (n=2) --> 8 electrons

2.3 Electronic Configuration

Shows arrangement of electrons.

Examples:

Hydrogen = 1

Carbon = 2,4

Oxygen = 2,6

Sodium = 2,8,1

2.4 Valency

Valency = combining capacity of an element.

Examples:

Na = 1

Cl = 1

O = 2

N = 3

Formulas (Plain Text Format)

Max electrons in orbit = 2 * n^2
Valence Electrons = electrons in outermost shell
Charge on Ion = Protons - Electrons

CHAPTER 3: Chemical Bonding
3.1 Why Do Atoms Bond?

Atoms bond to become stable by achieving octet (8 electrons in outer shell).

3.2 Types of Chemical Bonds
1. Ionic Bond

Transfer of electrons

Formed between metal + non-metal

Example:
Na (2,8,1) gives 1 electron to Cl (2,8,7)

Formation:
Na --> Na+
Cl --> Cl-

Ionic compound: NaCl

2. Covalent Bond

Sharing of electrons

Formed between two non-metals

Examples:

H2

O2

CO2

H2O

3. Metallic Bond

Free moving electrons (electron sea model)

Found in metals

3.3 Properties
Ionic	Covalent
High melting point	Low melting point
Conducts when molten	Poor conductor
Usually solid	solid/liquid/gas
Formulas (Plain Text Format)

Octet = 8 electrons in valence shell
Ionic Bond = Metal donates electron + Nonmetal accepts
Covalent Bond = Sharing of electrons

CHAPTER 4: States of Matter & Gas Laws
4.1 Three States

Solid (strong forces)

Liquid (medium forces)

Gas (weak forces)

4.2 Gas Laws
Boyle’s Law

Pressure * Volume = Constant
P1 * V1 = P2 * V2

Charles’ Law

V / T = Constant
V1 / T1 = V2 / T2

Gay-Lussac’s Law

P / T = Constant
P1 / T1 = P2 / T2

Ideal Gas Law

P * V = n * R * T

Formulas (Plain Text Format)

Boyle: P1 * V1 = P2 * V2
Charles: V1 / T1 = V2 / T2
Gay Lussac: P1 / T1 = P2 / T2
Ideal Gas: P * V = n * R * T

CHAPTER 5: Acids, Bases & Salts
5.1 Definitions

Acid:
Releases H+ ions in water
Example: HCl, H2SO4

Base:
Releases OH- ions
Example: NaOH, KOH

Salt:
Formed by acid + base reaction
Example: NaCl, CaSO4

5.2 pH Scale

Measures acidity and basicity.

Range:
0 to 14

pH < 7 --> Acid

pH = 7 --> Neutral

pH > 7 --> Base

5.3 Neutralization Reaction

Acid + Base --> Salt + Water

Example:
HCl + NaOH --> NaCl + H2O

5.4 Important Acids & Bases

HCl (Hydrochloric acid)

HNO3 (Nitric acid)

H2SO4 (Sulfuric acid)

NaOH (Sodium hydroxide)

Ca(OH)2 (Calcium hydroxide)

Formulas (Plain Text Format)

pH = -log10(H+)
Acid + Base = Salt + Water
Example: HCl + NaOH = NaCl + H2O
Molarity = Moles / Volume(L)
