# **CHAPTER 1: MOTION**

## **1.1 Introduction**

Motion refers to the change in position of an object with time. When an object moves from one place to another, it is said to be in motion.

## **1.2 Distance and Displacement**

* **Distance:** Total length of the path travelled. *Scalar quantity.*
* **Displacement:** Shortest straight-line distance between initial and final position. *Vector quantity.*

### **Formulas**

```
Speed = Distance / Time
Velocity = Displacement / Time
Acceleration = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Time
```

## **1.3 Types of Motion**

* **Uniform Motion:** Constant speed.
* **Non-uniform Motion:** Speed changes.
* **Uniformly Accelerated Motion:** Constant acceleration (e.g., free fall).

## **1.4 Equations of Motion (for constant acceleration)**

```
v = u + a*t
s = u*t + 0.5*a*t*t
v*v = u*u + 2*a*s
```

Where:

* u = initial velocity
* v = final velocity
* a = acceleration
* s = displacement
* t = time

## **1.5 Graphs of Motion**

* Distance-Time: straight line → uniform speed
* Velocity-Time: slope gives acceleration
* Area under v-t graph = displacement

# **CHAPTER 2: FORCE & NEWTON'S LAWS**

## **2.1 Force**

A push or pull that changes the state of motion of an object.

### **Formula**

```
Force = Mass * Acceleration
F = m * a
```

## **2.2 Newton's Three Laws**

### **First Law (Law of Inertia)**

A body remains at rest or moves in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.

### **Second Law**

Rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to force.

Momentum:

```
Momentum (p) = m * v
```

### **Third Law**

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

## **2.3 Friction**

Force that opposes motion.

Types:

* Static friction
* Kinetic friction
* Rolling friction

# **CHAPTER 3: WORK, ENERGY & POWER**

## **3.1 Work**

Work is done when a force moves an object in the direction of force.

### **Formula**

```
Work = Force * Displacement
W = F * s
```

## **3.2 Energy**

Capacity to do work.

### **Types**

* Kinetic Energy (motion)
* Potential Energy (position)

### **Formulas**

```
Kinetic Energy (KE) = 0.5 * m * v * v
Potential Energy (PE) = m * g * h
```

## **3.3 Power**

Rate of doing work.

```
Power = Work / Time
P = W / t
```

Unit: Watt (W)

# **CHAPTER 4: GRAVITATION**

## **4.1 Universal Law of Gravitation**

Every object attracts every other object with a force.

### **Formula**

```
F = G * m1 * m2 / (r * r)
```

Where:

* G = 6.67 * 10^-11
* m1, m2 = masses
* r = distance between them

## **4.2 Acceleration due to Gravity**

Earth pulls objects with acceleration **g**.

```
g = 9.8 m/s^2
Weight W = m * g
```

## **4.3 Free Fall**

Object falling under gravity alone.

Equations of motion apply with `a = g`.

# **CHAPTER 5: LIGHT (REFLECTION & REFRACTION)**

## **5.1 Reflection of Light**

Bouncing of light from a surface.

### **Laws of Reflection**

1. Angle of incidence = angle of reflection
2. Incident ray, reflected ray & normal lie on same plane

## **5.2 Mirror Formula**

For spherical mirrors:

```
1/f = 1/v + 1/u
```

magnification:

```
m = -v/u
```

## **5.3 Refraction**

Bending of light when passing from one medium to another.

### **Snell's Law**

```
n1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(r)
```

Refractive index:

```
n = Speed of light in vacuum / Speed of light in medium
```

## **5.4 Lens Formula**

```
1/f = 1/v - 1/u
```

Magnification:

m = v/u
