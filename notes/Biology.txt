🌱 CHAPTER 1: THE CELL — STRUCTURE & FUNCTIONS
1.1 What is a Cell?

A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of life.
All living organisms are made of cells.

Types of organisms based on cell number:

Unicellular → Single cell (Amoeba, Paramecium)

Multicellular → Many cells (Humans, Plants)

1.2 Cell Theory

Proposed by Schleiden & Schwann
Later expanded by Virchow

Cell Theory States:

All living organisms are made of cells.

The cell is the structural and functional unit of life.

All cells arise from pre-existing cells.

1.3 Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells

Prokaryotic:

No nucleus

Example: Bacteria

No membrane-bound organelles

Eukaryotic:

True nucleus present

Example: Humans, Plants

Complex organelles present

1.4 Cell Organelles & Functions

Nucleus

Control center of the cell

Contains DNA

Mitochondria

Powerhouse of the cell

Produces energy

Releases ATP
Formula:
ATP Production = Glucose + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + Energy

Ribosomes

Protein synthesis

Golgi Apparatus

Packaging and transport

Lysosomes

Digestive enzymes

"Suicidal bags"

Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):

Rough ER = Protein synthesis

Smooth ER = Lipid synthesis

Chloroplast (plants only):

Photosynthesis
Formula:
6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2

Vacuoles

Storage

🌿 CHAPTER 2: TISSUES
2.1 What are Tissues?

A group of similar cells performing a common function.

2.2 Plant Tissues

1. Meristematic Tissue (Growth)

Types:

Apical Meristem → Length

Lateral Meristem → Thickness

Intercalary → Internode growth

2. Permanent Tissues

Parenchyma (Support & Storage)

Collenchyma (Flexibility)

Sclerenchyma (Hardness)

Conducting Tissues:

Xylem → Water transport

Phloem → Food transport

2.3 Animal Tissues

1. Epithelial Tissue

Covers body surfaces

Example: Skin lining

2. Connective Tissue

Bone

Blood

Tendons

Cartilage

3. Muscle Tissue

Skeletal (voluntary)

Smooth (involuntary)

Cardiac (involuntary)

4. Nervous Tissue

Made of neurons

Transfers information

🌾 CHAPTER 3: NUTRITION
3.1 Nutrition in Plants

Plants make their own food → Autotrophic nutrition

Photosynthesis Formula:
6CO2 + 6H2O + Sunlight -> C6H12O6 + 6O2

Requirements:

Chlorophyll

Sunlight

CO2

Water

3.2 Nutrition in Humans

Steps:

Ingestion

Digestion

Absorption

Assimilation

Egestion

Major Digestive Organs:

Mouth

Stomach

Small Intestine

Liver (makes bile)

Pancreas (makes enzymes)

Large Intestine

Enzyme Summary:

Amylase -> Breaks starch into maltose
Protease -> Breaks proteins into amino acids
Lipase -> Breaks fats into fatty acids + glycerol

🌬️ CHAPTER 4: HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
4.1 What is Respiration?

Process of releasing energy from food.

Two types:

Aerobic Respiration: Uses oxygen

Anaerobic Respiration: No oxygen (muscle cramps caused by lactic acid)

4.2 Parts of Respiratory System

Nose

Pharynx

Larynx

Trachea

Bronchi

Bronchioles

Alveoli (site of gas exchange)

4.3 Breathing Process

Inhalation:

Diaphragm moves down

Chest expands

Air enters lungs

Exhalation:

Diaphragm moves up

Chest contracts

Air leaves lungs

4.4 Respiration Formula
Glucose + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + Energy

❤️ CHAPTER 5: HUMAN CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
5.1 What is Circulation?

Transport of nutrients, gases, and wastes in the body.

5.2 Components of the Circulatory System

Heart

Blood

Blood vessels

5.3 Structure of Heart

Four chambers:

Right Atrium

Right Ventricle

Left Atrium

Left Ventricle

Valves → prevent backflow

5.4 Types of Blood Vessels

Arteries:

Carry blood away from heart

Thick walls

Veins:

Carry blood towards heart

Thin walls

Have valves

Capillaries:

One cell thick

Exchange of gases

5.5 Blood Composition
RBC -> Carries oxygen (contains hemoglobin)
WBC -> Fights infection
Platelets -> Helps in clotting
Plasma -> Fluid part

5.6 Double Circulation

Blood goes through the heart twice for every complete cycle:

Pulmonary circulation

Systemic circulation
